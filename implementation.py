"""NACO assignment 22/23.

This file contains the skeleton code required to solve the first part of the 
assignment for the NACO course 2022. 

You can test your algorithm by using the function `test_algorithm`. For passing A1,
your GA should be able to pass the checks in this function for dimension=100.

## Installing requirements
You are encouraged to use a virtual environment. Install the required dependencies 
(via the command line) with the following command:
    pip install ioh>=0.3.3
